# Credit Card Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning

Credit card attrition, the phenomenon where customers cancel or stop using their credit cards, is a significant concern for credit card companies. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn can help these companies take proactive measures to retain their customer base. In this data mining project, we will explore the use of three popular machine learning algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees - to predict credit card attrition.
